## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
### Option1 - open link
link: https://maanasverma-test.github.io/pracai-homepage/

### Option 2 – Open Directly 

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click `index.html`.
4. The website will open in your browser.

---

### Option 3 – Using a Local Server 

You can use:

- VS Code Live Server

- Or any static file server

Example using GitHub Pages:

1. Go to repository Settings.
2. Click **Pages**.
3. Select:
   - Source → Deploy from branch
   - Branch → main
4. Save.
##  Assumptions Made

1. The project is frontend-only and does not require backend integration.
2. Login, Sign Up, and Contact functionalities are UI-based and not connected to any server.
3. Placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum) was used where actual content was not provided in the design.
4. Image assets are stored inside the `/assets` folder.
5. Dropdown menu is implemented using CSS hover behavior for simplicity.
6. FAQ accordion animation uses a fixed `max-height` for smooth transitions.
7. Responsive behavior is designed primarily for desktop, tablet (≤992px), and mobile (≤768px) breakpoints.
8. The website is intended to be deployed as a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages).
##  Known Issues

1. Dropdown navigation is hover-based and may require JavaScript enhancement for better mobile support.
2. FAQ animation may require adjustment if answers become significantly longer.
3. No form validation is implemented for the Subscribe or Contact section.
4. Accessibility features (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support) can be improved.
5. No backend authentication system is implemented.
6. Some layout spacing may slightly vary across different browsers.
7. Horizontal scroll in the Reviews section depends on browser behavior.
